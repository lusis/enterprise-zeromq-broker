# Enterprise class ZeroMQ Broker with built-in clustering!
This repo contains previously secret government code for an enterprise ZeroMQ broker with loadbalancing.

Through much negotiation, we are now able to release this code to the public for everyone to use.

## Usage
`./enterprise-zeromq-broker <frontend port> <backend port>`

Front end port is where clients send messages. Backend port is where clients connect to consume messages.
